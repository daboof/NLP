      "to sherlock holmes she is always the woman i have seldom heard himmention her under any other name in his eyes she eclipses andpredominates the whole of her sex it was not that he felt any emotionakin to love for irene adler all emotions and that one particularlywere abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind hewas i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine thatthe world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in afalse position he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibeand a sneer they were admirable things for the observer—excellent fordrawing the veil from men’s motives and actions but for the trainedreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finelyadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which mightthrow a doubt upon all his mental results grit in a sensitiveinstrument or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses would notbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his andyet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late ireneadler of dubious and questionable memoryi had seen little of holmes lately my marriage had drifted us awayfrom each other my own complete happiness and the homecentredinterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself masterof his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attentionwhile holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemiansoul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his oldbooks and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambitionthe drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keennature he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crimeand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers ofobservation in following out those clues and clearing up thosemysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official policefrom time to time i heard some vague account of his doings of hissummons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing upof the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee andfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately andsuccessfully for the reigning family of holland beyond these signs ofhis activity however which i merely shared with all the readers ofthe daily press i knew little of my former friend and companionone night—it was on the twentieth of march 1888—i was returning from ajourney to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice whenmy way led me through baker street as i passed the wellremembereddoor which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing andwith the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with akeen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing hisextraordinary powers his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as ilooked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouetteagainst the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with hishead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me whoknew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their ownstory he was at work again he had risen out of his drugcreateddreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem i rang the belland was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my ownhis manner was not effusive it seldom was but he was glad i thinkto see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he wavedme to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated aspirit case and a gasogene in the corner then he stood before the fireand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion“wedlock suits you” he remarked “i think watson that you have puton seven and a half pounds since i saw you”“seven” i answered“indeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more ifancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell methat you intended to go into harness”“then how do you know”“i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been gettingyourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and carelessservant girl”“my dear holmes” said i “this is too much you would certainly havebeen burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that i had acountry walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as ihave changed my clothes i can’t imagine how you deduce it as to maryjane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but thereagain i fail to see how you work it out”he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together“it is simplicity itself” said he “my eyes tell me that on the insideof your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather isscored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused bysomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole inorder to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my doublededuction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had aparticularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the london slavey asto your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling ofiodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his rightforefinger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show wherehe has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do notpronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession”i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained hisprocess of deduction “when i hear you give your reasons” i remarked“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that icould easily do it myself though at each successive instance of yourreasoning i am baffled until you explain your process and yet ibelieve that my eyes are as good as yours”“quite so” he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himselfdown into an armchair “you see but you do not observe thedistinction is clear for example you have frequently seen the stepswhich lead up from the hall to this room”“frequently”“how often”“well some hundreds of times”“then how many are there”“how many i don’t know”“quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is justmy point now i know that there are seventeen steps because i haveboth seen and observed by the way since you are interested in theselittle problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or twoof my trifling experiences you may be interested in this” he threwover a sheet of thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying openupon the table “it came by the last post” said he “read it aloud”the note was undated and without either signature or address“there will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight o’clock” itsaid “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the verydeepest moment your recent services to one of the royal houses ofeurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted withmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggeratedthis account of you we have from all quarters received be in yourchamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitorwear a mask”“this is indeed a mystery” i remarked “what do you imagine that itmeans”“i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorise before one hasdata insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead oftheories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce fromit”i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it waswritten“the man who wrote it was presumably well to do” i remarkedendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes “such paper could notbe bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong andstiff”“peculiar—that is the very word” said holmes “it is not an englishpaper at all hold it up to the light”i did so and saw a large “e” with a small “g” a “p” and a large “g”with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper“what do you make of that” asked holmes“the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather”“not at all the ‘g’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘gesellschaft’which is the german for ‘company’ it is a customary contraction likeour ‘co’ ‘p’ of course stands for ‘papier’ now for the ‘eg’ let usglance at our continental gazetteer” he took down a heavy brown volumefrom his shelves “eglow eglonitz—here we are egria it is in agermanspeaking country—in bohemia not far from carlsbad ‘remarkableas being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerousglassfactories and papermills’ ha ha my boy what do you make ofthat” his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloudfrom his cigarette“the paper was made in bohemia” i said“precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note thepeculiar construction of the sentence—‘this account of you we have fromall quarters received’ a frenchman or russian could not have writtenthat it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it onlyremains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german whowrites upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing hisface and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all ourdoubts”as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and gratingwheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell holmeswhistled“a pair by the sound” said he “yes” he continued glancing out ofthe window “a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundredand fifty guineas apiece there’s money in this case watson if thereis nothing else”“i think that i had better go holmes”“not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswelland this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it”“but your client—”“never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comessit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention”a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in thepassage paused immediately outside the door then there was a loud andauthoritative tap“come in” said holmes“you had my note” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a stronglymarked german accent “i told you that i would call” he looked fromone to the other of us as if uncertain which to address“pray take a seat” said holmes “this is my friend and colleague drwatson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whomhave i the honour to address”“you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman iunderstand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour anddiscretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extremeimportance if not i should much prefer to communicate with youalone”i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back intomy chair “it is both or none” said he “you may say before thisgentleman anything which you may say to me”the count shrugged his broad shoulders “then i must begin” said he“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end ofthat time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not toomuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence uponeuropean history”“i promise” said holmes“and i”“you will excuse this mask” continued our strange visitor “the augustperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i mayconfess at once that the title by which i have just called myself isnot exactly my own”“i was aware of it” said holmes dryly“the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has tobe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal andseriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speakplainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditarykings of bohemia”“i was also aware of that” murmured holmes settling himself down inhis armchair and closing his eyesour visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languidlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as themost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe holmesslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client“if your majesty would condescend to state your case” he remarked “ishould be better able to advise you”the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room inuncontrollable agitation then with a gesture of desperation he torethe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground “you are right”he cried “i am the king why should i attempt to conceal it”“why indeed” murmured holmes “your majesty had not spoken before iwas aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond vonormstein grand duke of casselfelstein and hereditary king ofbohemia”“but you can understand” said our strange visitor sitting down oncemore and passing his hand over his high white forehead “you canunderstand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my ownperson yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it toan agent without putting myself in his power i have come incognitofrom prague for the purpose of consulting you”“then pray consult” said holmes shutting his eyes once more“the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthyvisit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuressirene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you”“kindly look her up in my index doctor” murmured holmes withoutopening his eyes for many years he had adopted a system of docketingall paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult toname a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnishinformation in this case i found her biography sandwiched in betweenthat of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staffcommander who had written amonograph upon the deepsea fishes“let me see” said holmes “hum born in new jersey in the year 1858contralto—hum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera of warsaw—yesretired from operatic stage—ha living in london—quite so yourmajesty as i understand became entangled with this young personwrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of gettingthose letters back”“precisely so but how—”“was there a secret marriage”“none”“no legal papers or certificates”“none”“then i fail to follow your majesty if this young person shouldproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she toprove their authenticity”“there is the writing”“pooh pooh forgery”“my private notepaper”“stolen”“my own seal”“imitated”“my photograph”“bought”“we were both in the photograph”“oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed anindiscretion”“i was mad—insane”“you have compromised yourself seriously”“i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now”“it must be recovered”“we have tried and failed”“your majesty must pay it must be bought”“she will not sell”“stolen then”“five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked herhouse once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she hasbeen waylaid there has been no result”“no sign of it”“absolutely none”holmes laughed “it is quite a pretty little problem” said he“but a very serious one to me” returned the king reproachfully“very indeed and what does she propose to do with the photograph”“to ruin me”“but how”“i am about to be married”“so i have heard”“to clotilde lothman von saxemeningen second daughter of the king ofscandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she isherself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conductwould bring the matter to an end”“and irene adler”“threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know thatshe will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel shehas the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the mostresolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are nolengths to which she would not go—none”“you are sure that she has not sent it yet”“i am sure”“and why”“because she has said that she would send it on the day when thebetrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday”“oh then we have three days yet” said holmes with a yawn “that isvery fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look intojust at present your majesty will of course stay in london for thepresent”“certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the countvon kramm”“then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress”“pray do so i shall be all anxiety”“then as to money”“you have carte blanche”“absolutely”“i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom tohave that photograph”“and for present expenses”the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laidit on the table“there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes” hesaidholmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed itto him“and mademoiselle’s address” he asked“is briony lodge serpentine avenue st john’s wood”holmes took a note of it “one other question” said he “was thephotograph a cabinet”“it was”“then goodnight your majesty and i trust that we shall soon havesome good news for you and goodnight watson” he added as thewheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street “if you will begood enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three o’clock i should liketo chat this little matter over with you”iiat three o’clock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had notyet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the houseshortly after eight o’clock in the morning i sat down beside the firehowever with the intention of awaiting him however long he might bei was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it wassurrounded by none of the grim and strange features which wereassociated with the two crimes which i have already recorded stillthe nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it acharacter of its own indeed apart from the nature of theinvestigation which my friend had on hand there was something in hismasterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning whichmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow thequick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricablemysteries so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the verypossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my headit was close upon four before the door opened and a drunkenlookinggroom illkempt and sidewhiskered with an inflamed face anddisreputable clothes walked into the room accustomed as i was to myfriend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises i had to look threetimes before i was certain that it was indeed he with a nod hevanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutestweedsuited and respectable as of old putting his hands into hispockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughedheartily for some minutes“well really” he cried and then he choked and laughed again until hewas obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair“what is it”“it’s quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employedmy morning or what i ended by doing”“i can’t imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits andperhaps the house of miss irene adler”“quite so but the sequel was rather unusual i will tell you howeveri left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in thecharacter of a groom out of work there is a wonderful sympathy andfreemasonry among horsey men be one of them and you will know allthat there is to know i soon found briony lodge it is a bijouvilla with a garden at the back but built out in front right up tothe road two stories chubb lock to the door large sittingroom onthe right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floorand those preposterous english window fasteners which a child couldopen behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage windowcould be reached from the top of the coachhouse i walked round it andexamined it closely from every point of view but without notinganything else of interest“i then lounged down the street and found as i expected that therewas a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden i lentthe ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received inexchange twopence a glass of halfandhalf two fills of shag tobaccoand as much information as i could desire about miss adler to saynothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i wasnot in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled tolisten to”“and what of irene adler” i asked“oh she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part she is thedaintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet so say theserpentinemews to a man she lives quietly sings at concerts drivesout at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner seldomgoes out at other times except when she sings has only one malevisitor but a good deal of him he is dark handsome and dashingnever calls less than once a day and often twice he is a mr godfreynorton of the inner temple see the advantages of a cabman as aconfidant they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentinemewsand knew all about him when i had listened to all they had to tell ibegan to walk up and down near briony lodge once more and to thinkover my plan of campaign“this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matterhe was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation betweenthem and what the object of his repeated visits was she his clienthis friend or his mistress if the former she had probablytransferred the photograph to his keeping if the latter it was lesslikely on the issue of this question depended whether i shouldcontinue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to thegentleman’s chambers in the temple it was a delicate point and itwidened the field of my inquiry i fear that i bore you with thesedetails but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you areto understand the situation”“i am following you closely” i answered“i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove upto briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out he was a remarkablyhandsome man dark aquiline and moustached—evidently the man of whomi had heard he appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabmanto wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air ofa man who was thoroughly at home“he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch glimpses ofhim in the windows of the sittingroom pacing up and down talkingexcitedly and waving his arms of her i could see nothing presentlyhe emerged looking even more flurried than before as he stepped up tothe cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at itearnestly ‘drive like the devil’ he shouted ‘first to gross hankey’s in regent street and then to the church of st monica in theedgeware road half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes’\n"
